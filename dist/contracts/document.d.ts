 * can ask for and change.
 *
 * A CONTRACT module, not a barrel. `contracts/editor` builds the `Editor` command and query
 * surfaces on top of these, so they cannot live in the package root: the root re-exports
 * runtime from `../editor`, and a contract importing the root would invert the dependency —
 * safe today only because that import is type-only, and one accidental value import away from
 * pulling the painted engine into a server bundle.
