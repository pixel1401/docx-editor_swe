/**
 * `@docx-editor.dev/core/automation` — the host protocol document automation runs against.
 *
 * One interface with two implementations: a headless host owning bytes it opened, and a browser
 * host borrowing the live editor's session. Both answer the same operations identically, because
 * the operations are implemented once above this protocol.
 *
 * Everything here is transport-shaped — a handle is a NAME, never a pointer — so the same host
 * works behind a worker port, an HTTP boundary, or nothing at all.

// The automation lane: one transport-neutral host port for document automation.
//
// An automation object model — the batching, promise-shaped API a script or an agent
// programs against — needs exactly two things from the engine: a way to name objects in a
// document, and a way to send an ordered batch of reads and writes at it. Everything else
// about it is transport. This lane is that port, and nothing above it.
//
// It is DELIBERATELY the same port for a server and for a live editor. Two hand-written
// hosts would be two document models, and the second one always ends up deriving authority
// from whatever it can see — painted DOM, a projection, a cached read — which is how a
// scripted edit and a typed edit stop agreeing. Here both hosts hand this lane a
// `AutomationDocumentPort` over the SAME canonical package and the SAME
// `TreeDocumentStore.transact` write path, and every read and every operation is
// implemented once, above the port.
//
// Neutral means neutral: no DOM, no framework, no Node builtin, no editor lane. The lane's
// own tsconfig omits the DOM lib so a `document` reference here cannot compile, and
// `__tests__/automation-lane-boundary.test.ts` walks the lane's real import graph.

// The protocol: what a host is, what a batch is, and what can go wrong.
