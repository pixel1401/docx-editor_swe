// The automation host protocol.
//
// One interface, two implementations: a headless host that owns a package it opened from
// bytes, and a browser host that borrows the live editor's session. Both answer the same
// operations with the same results, because the operations themselves are implemented once,
// above this protocol, over a canonical package neither host is allowed to bypass.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS TRANSPORT-SHAPED ON PURPOSE. A request is data, a response is data, and
// a handle is a name rather than a pointer — so the same host can sit behind a worker
// message port, an HTTP boundary, or nothing at all, without the protocol changing shape at
// the moment it crosses one. That is also why nothing in this file names an `OoxmlNode`, a
// store, or a DOM node: a value a consumer receives must not be a reference into the engine.
